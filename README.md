# Flare: Federated Learning with Blockchain and IoT Focus

Flare is a Python library for simulating and implementing federated learning systems.
It aims to provide a modular and extensible framework for experimenting with:
- Diverse machine learning models (traditional ML, deep learning, transformers).
- Various model compression techniques.
- Different blockchain consensus and storage mechanisms (e.g., IPFS).
- Optimization for IoT device constraints.

## Features (Planned)

- [ ] Modular architecture for easy customization.
- [ ] Support for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn models.
- [ ] Pluggable compression algorithms.
- [ ] Blockchain interface for consensus and metadata logging (mock and Web3).
- [ ] Storage options including local, IPFS, and direct network.
- [ ] Simulation environment for federated learning scenarios.
- [ ] Focus on efficiency for IoT deployment.
